	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	
<p>Sherlock is a Consulting detective - a self made profession where detectives go consult him when they have an unsolved mystery. <br>
This is all possible because Holmes is a genius and highly observant intellect. He is able to conclude deductions form the smallest <br>
of details and uses a mind palace to store and organise information  he encounters with every problem. Sherlock prides himself in <br>
his abilities and usually mocks others for not being able to see things the way he envisions them. He defines himself as a high-<br>
functioning sociopath, but throughout the show Sherlock does demonstrate emotions of compassion and empathy. 
Disorders Sherlock<br>
may face include: autism spectrum, and Asperger's syndrome.
</p>	
<p>
While Sherlock is a character that is set to resolve issues and problems, he also faces on drugs like nicotine and heroin to keep his<br>
brain on a constant. 
</p>
<p>Throughout the show Sherlock builds a connection with his close ones like Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper, his older brother, Mycroft <br>
Holmes, and especially his roommate <a href="John.html"> John Watson </a>. </p>

	<h2> But WHO IS Sherlock Holmes?</h2>
	<p>Although it would be interesting to see the series of events unfold in real life, William Sherlock Scott Holmes is played by Benedict Cumberbatch ~ See Characters in the Home Page.</p>
	<h2>Benedict interview on Sherlock</h2>
	<p>Benedict exclaims a character trait that he would want from his charachter Sherlock: His mental focus, which comes with its <br>
	faults as well, it’s very hard-earned. What I love about him is he is a hero for people who are different and a role model for <br>
	people who are different because he acquires a status through his skill that is bar none and I would love to have his mental <br>
	agility and focus I just think it is exceptional... and his memory, if I can have two!
