   I usually don’t watch TV shows for many reasons: loses quality <br>
   content, repeativness, low budget, and typically hard to keep up with. <br>
   However BBC’s Sherlock was so enriching and elaborate, I ended up <br>
   rewatching the series repeatedly over and over.  The story was well <br>
   thought out and the actors performed their characters to have strengths<br>
   and weaknesses and made each scene plausible. It is also wonderful <br>
   how the story was adapted to be modernized and yet keep elements of <br>
   the original stories. Another great part of the story is how it presents<br>
   the theme of mystery. Since we are able to see  and hear what Sherlock <br>
   is thinking (as he usually talks about his thoughts to John).</font> </p>
