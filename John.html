	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	
<p>John is a Former Doctor for the Army and when first introduced, he was both mentally and physically harmed from his service.To add he <br>
was unemployed and had no close family to help him out. Conveniently <a href="Sherlock.html">Sherlock Holmes</a> is looking for a roommate at 22B Baker Street. Although <br>
he is desperate to calm Sherlock down at times, John is adventurous and likes following Sherlock on cases.  Sherlock deducts that: “You’re not <br>
haunted by the war, Dr. Watson. You miss it”.  John holds a duality of personality as he was both a soldier and a doctor, as soldiers kill while<br>
doctors save. This balance makes Watson a more complex and interesting character as, unlike Sherlock holds importance to the value of life and <br>
at the same time is capable of seeing the dangers life bring. What John lacks in observing, he makes up for it with a humane personality. One of<br>
the best qualities of John are his moral principles, he carries the emotions and heart of the relationship between himself and Sherlock and <br>
nags at Sherlock for inappropriate behaviour to others. He is able to forgive Sherlock and also gain respect from him as well.

	<h2> But WHO IS John Watson?</h2>
	<p>Martin Freeman does a brilliant preformace playing as the Army Doctor. ~ See Characters in the Home Page.</p>
	<h2>Martin's take on the John and Sherlock Duo</h2>
	<p>Martin describes the relationship between the two flatmates progess: By the end of the first series you saw John and Sherlock's relationship <br>
	moving on, John went from being merely 'agog' at everything Sherlock did to being just miffed at some of his actions. That takes <br> 
	a step further in the new series and I would say it is definitely a partnership now, with Sherlock being the main thrust, but John is <br>
	only half a step behind, as opposed to six steps behind."</p>
